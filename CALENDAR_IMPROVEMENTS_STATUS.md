# 📅 Calendar Improvements - Status Report

## ✅ What We Fixed Today

### 🕐 **Time Display & Layout**
- **Fixed time labels**: Now shows clean "8 AM, 9 AM, 10 AM" instead of "8:30, 9:30"
- **Perfect timing**: Calendar starts exactly at 8 AM and ends at 7 PM
- **No gaps**: Removed the 30-minute blank space at the top
- **Hourly grid**: Clean hourly separators (no half-hour lines)

### 🔲 **Gray Areas (Unavailable Times)**
- **Salon closed hours**: When salon closes (e.g., 6 PM), all hours after that are grayed out
- **Staff unavailable**: When staff is not working, their column shows gray overlay
- **Breaks & Leaves**: Staff breaks and leave days are properly highlighted in gray
- **Smart coverage**: Gray areas extend properly to show unavailability

### 💬 **Tooltips (Hover Information)**
- **Hover to see details**: When you hover over gray areas, you see exactly why it's unavailable
- **Clear messages**: 
  - "Salon is closed during this time (18:00 - 20:00)"
  - "John is not scheduled to work"
  - "Jane is on break"
  - "Mike is on leave"
- **Time ranges**: Shows exact time periods for each unavailable slot

### 📱 **Visual Improvements**
- **Better spacing**: Added proper margins so calendar doesn't stick to screen edges
- **Clean layout**: Professional appearance with breathing room
- **Mobile friendly**: Works well on all screen sizes
